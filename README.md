# MRI
Code for analyzing structural and functional MRI data  
Developed by Peter J. Kohler, 2016-  
Improved versions of existing shell functions, now converted to Python   
Every script makes local, temporary copies of relevant files, for speed   
Currently, those copies are put on Desktop, which may not be kosher to some, but helps with debugging.   
Requires the following software packages  
- AFNI
- fsl
- freesurfer
